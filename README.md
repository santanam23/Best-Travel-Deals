# Front-End-Project

As a User I want to find the best deals and discounts on travel so I can have a more economic vacation.

I will be using Skyscanner to find flight deals within the US (in case skyscanner doesn't work we will use NextBus as a source for a deal)

I will use TripAdvisor to find the best travel deals and discounts

I will use Compare Flight Prices to ensure I get the best deal
